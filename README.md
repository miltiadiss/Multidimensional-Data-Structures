This project is part of **Multidimensional Data Strucrures & Computational Geometry** elective course in Computer Engineering & Informatics Department of University of Patras for Winter Semester 2023 (Semester 7).

We will be using **kd-Trees**, **Quad-Trees**, **R-Trees** and **Range Trees** in order to answer to spatial range queries.
