# Overview
This project is part of **Multidimensional Data Strucrures & Computational Geometry** elective course in Computer Engineering & Informatics Department of University of Patras for Winter Semester 2023-2024 (Semester 7).

## Dataset
The Dataset that we will be using for this project is created with the aid of a web crawler that scans data form this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_scientists and creates a CSV file.

Every tuple of the final CSV file will have this format: (**Surname**:String, **#Awards**:Integer, **Education**:text-vector, **#DBLP_Record**). The 3 features **Surname**, **#Awards** and **#DBLP_Record** will be used for the indexing by the Multidimensional Structures.


## Goals
We will be using **kd-Trees**, **Quad-Trees**, **R-Trees** and **Range Trees** in order to answer to spatial range queries.
